# Exercise 7: Return the count of a given substring from a string
# Write a program to find how many times substring “Peter” appears in the given string.

# pseudocode

# write a sentence
sentence = "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked; If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, Where's the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?"
print (sentence)

# use the count method of a str class
count_words = sentence.count ("Peter")

# print how many time the word is repeated
